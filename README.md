# task
a simple to-do list application

I find myself forgetting things often - assignments, errands, chores, etc.
With this application I hope to achieve the following:
-simple (!) ux
-flexible scheduling system
-extreme lightweight design
-make it look nice

How will I do these things? Updates to come :)
